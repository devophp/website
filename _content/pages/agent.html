# The Devophp Agent Component

The **Agent** is a crucial component, as it is installed on all the nodes you wish to control through Devophp.
The **Agent** receives commands to execute on the node, for example from the [Monitor](/monitor).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

To run the agents on your nodes, you'll need the following packages installed:

* php-cli
* git
* composer 

### Installation

Installing the agent on your nodes is easy. simply follow these instructions:

    mkdir -p /usr/local/devophp/
    cd /usr/local/devophp/
    git clone git@github.com:devophp/agent.git
    cd agent
    composer install
    
### Configuration

//TODO: Document the config file

### Starting the agent

Start the agent using the following command:

    ./bin/console agent:daemon
    

## Communication

The Agent only communicates directly with a message queue. It subscribes to a topic to watch for commands.
Once a command is sent to the topic (by the [Monitor](/monitor)), the Agent will execute the command.

The Agent can report back the output of the command back to the message queue.

## Plugins

The **Agent** in itself does not provide any direct functionality.
All functionality is implemented by Agent plugins.

### Available plugins

#### Nagios plugin

The Nagios Agent Plugin implements the `nagios:check` command.

By sending this command to the agent, you can execute nagios plugins (called 'checks').
Each Nagios check outputs a simple statuscode (OK, Warning or Critical) and optional details, which will be
reported back to the Monitor.
