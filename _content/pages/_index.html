# About Devophp

Devophp is a set of decoupled devops components, implemented in PHP.
It provides a core platform for communication that can be used for a wide range of practical solutions. For example:

* System monitorring
* Distributed firewall management
* Metrics collection
* Configuration management
* Application deployment
* Distributed commands
* ... etc, it's easy to add new plugins

Think of it as nice blend between nagios, puppet, collectd, statsd, capistrano, mcollective, shipyard, security groups, cloudformation and more.

The system is message-based, meaning that all communication flows through a message broker. There are no complicated firewall rules to set up on your nodes, all traffic is outbound to the message broker.

The code-base is designed with simplicity and extensibility in mind. It's easy to build new functionality on the existing components.

Projects can be used together for a full solution, or individually, as building blocks.

## The big picture

</center>

The 3 primary components of a Devophp setup are:

1. The agent (running on all of your nodes)
2. The message queue
3. The monitor

None of the components communicate directly with eachother. All communication runs through the message queue.

### The agent

The agent is installed on all of the nodes you wish to manage through Devophp.

It listens for commands on the message queue to be executed on the node.

### The message queue

The message queue is the communication channel between all of the components.

Currently the components support the STOMP protocol, which is implemented by Apache ActiveMQ.

Other message queues such as SQS or RabbitMQ can be supported by implementing a simple interface.

### The monitor

The Monitor component is keeping an eye on all of the nodes running the agent.
It schedules jobs (such as system checks), and processes reports coming back from the agents.
